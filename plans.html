                        To ensure Namma Yatri continues to make a positive impact to the rides ecosystem and to maintain our commitment to zero-commission rides and 100% direct payment, we've introduced Namma Yatri Plans for drivers. This is a small fee that we'll be collecting from our driver partners to cover basic costs of running their beloved app.

                        At Namma Yatri, our mission is to empower drivers and bring about a positive transformation in their lives. We believe in creating a ride-hailing ecosystem that benefits both drivers and riders. With our innovative approach, we introduced Zero Commission Rides and embraced 100% Openness, revolutionizing the ride-hailing industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Bengaluru, Namma Yatri has become synonymous with higher earnings for drivers and a more seamless experience for riders. It's this commitment to excellence that has earned us the title of Bengaluru's most beloved ride-hailing app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To continue making a positive impact on both drivers and riders, the Namma Yatri team has been tirelessly optimizing costs. While we've successfully reduced several expenses, infrastructure costs such as maps and servers are necessary to ensure thousands of daily rides run smoothly. To sustain Namma Yatri and maintain our commitment to zero-commission rides and 100% direct payment, we've introduced Namma Yatri Plans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These plans, available in our Driver app, offer two options: Daily Unlimited and Daily Per Trip. Not only are these plans significantly more affordable than those offered by other aggregators, but they also align with our fundamental principle of transparency. We remain steadfast in our promise of zero-commission rides and enabling direct payments from customers to drivers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dear drivers, by subscribing to Namma Yatri Plans, you become a true partner in the Namma Yatri journey, where every ride contributes to making a difference in the lives of our drivers and riders alike.
